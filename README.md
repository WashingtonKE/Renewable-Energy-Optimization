Renewable Energy Output Optimization (Energy Systems Engineering)
A renewable energy facility monitors power generation using output vectors across different
energy sources:
energy_output  = [solar, wind, hydro, battery_storage] (MW)
solar_MW

Note: Negative battery storage indicates discharging, positive indicates charging.
Generation Scenarios
  • Peak Demand: pd = [120, 85, 45,−30] (negative = discharging)
  • Low Demand: ld = [80, 95, 30, 25] (positive = charging)
  • Optimal Mix: om = [100, 90, 40, 0] (balanced generation)
  • Current Output: co = [95, 75, 35,−10]
  • Grid Demand Vector: gd = [1, 1, 1, 1] (equal preference for all sources)
